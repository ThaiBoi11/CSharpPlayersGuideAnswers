# CSharpPlayersGuideAnswers
 My answers to the questions and challenges presented in the C# Player's Guide 5th Edition, written by RB Whitaker. These are in no way definitive, perfect answers to the book, nor should these answers be used as a guide. I can be very stupid ~~sometimes~~ most of the time, so I wouldn't be surprised if most of this was unoptimised spaghetti code. This repository is simply a way for me to work on the book without having to carry my USB everywhere.
